# Smart Knee Brace  

This project involved designing a rehabilitation-focused knee brace that uses a Raspberry Pi and an integrated orientation sensor to monitor knee bending angles during recovery. The device helps patients, especially those recovering from injuries such as meniscus tears, avoid bending their knee past physician-recommended limits (e.g., 90Â°).  

The brace serves a dual purpose: providing knee support and giving real-time feedback to ensure safe rehabilitation.

## Features
- Provides alerts with vibration or buzzer when the knee bends beyond a safe angle  
- Tracks and logs knee angles over time using the Raspberry Pi  
- Generates weekly summaries and graphs of unsafe movements  
- Adjustable, lightweight, and portable design
