# Smart Knee Brace  

This project involved the design of a rehabilitation-focused knee brace with an integrated orientation sensor that monitors knee bending angles during recovery. The device helps patients, especially those recovering from injuries such as meniscus tears, avoid bending their knee past physician-recommended limits (e.g., 90Â°).  

The brace is made to a dual purpose: providing knee support and giving real-time feedback to ensure safe rehabilitation.
